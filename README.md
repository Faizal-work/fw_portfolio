# Hello World!

This is my newest-and-soon-to-be-consolidated git. Will decommission the others

Important things to cover:

1. OOP
2. SOLID ( like proper understanding and workings in C++, Javascript, PHP )
3. Yes, PHP and Laravel. They're good tools
4. Azure Function vs AppService
5. Serverless
6. Dockers
7. NoSQL + SQL
8. Scaling and what not

# Important things to cover

As per from the Claude.ai on estimation for number of request:

## Web Applications:

- Single server: ~1,000-5,000 concurrent users
- Load-balanced setup: ~10,000-50,000 concurrent users
- Well-architected system: ~100,000+ concurrent users

## Database:

- Single MySQL/PostgreSQL: ~10,000 reads/sec, ~1,000 writes/sec
- Properly indexed and optimized: ~50,000 reads/sec, ~5,000 writes/sec

## General Request Handling:

- Simple API endpoint: ~1,000-10,000 req/sec per server
- Complex business logic: ~100-1,000 req/sec per server

## What interviewers want to hear

You understand that scalability isn't just about bigger servers

You know common bottlenecks (database, memory, I/O)

You can discuss architectural patterns (caching, load balancing, microservices)

You recognize that "it depends" on the specific requirements
