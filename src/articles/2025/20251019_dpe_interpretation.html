        <h3>Dominos Real Life Example</h3>
        <p>
          Can you help me comprehend this statement: Practice this assessment.
          You can see we are letting you know in a quite detailed fashion what
          we will pair together to do. it also shows you the basic tools one of
          our devs needs to know and understand so they can free their DPE
          Dotnet React Typescript Pairing Session Assessment for the real work;
          understanding requirements, and using these tools to deliver those
          requirements. As we pair together to work through the solution, you
          will be asked questions to explain why you are doing it like you are
          doing it, what are alternative ways to do it. You will also be asked
          to add adhoc extensions and modifications to the above general path.
          If you have used the above task as a general path, and then studied
          and read about how to do this, and the pros and cons of different
          approaches you will shine in the interview. This is not an exam where
          you need to memorise. This is a pairing session simulating a ‚Äòday in
          the life º and how you can contribute to our teams. You are allowed and
          encouraged to have google open while you are pairing with us, and use
          it to figure out how to develop these solutions and answer the
          questions you will be asked. You are not allowed to use AI ÓÇÅChat GPT,
          CoPilot) while you work as we want to see how you research and how you
          judge the correct solution to implement (there is not really a wrong
          and right answer, talk through your reasoning with us). If you join
          us, we give you a macbook and GitHub Copilot anyway, so we are not
          anti-AI, but we do not use Chat GPT for security reasons.

        <h3>My understanding</h3>
        <p>
          I think the interviewer wants to have a look-and-feel of the project,
          just to practice some basics and understand the tool that I am going
          to use aka dotnet8. During the interview, they will allow me to use
          Google, or even maybe stackoverflow, try the example, check and
          understand how and why and even what are the situation and/or edge
          cases that might occur, and what the answer would be the right one. Is
          that right?
        </p>
        <h3>Additional Understanding</h3>
        <p>
          Yes, you've got the core idea right, but let me clarify and expand on
          what they're really saying: What They're Actually Telling You üéØ 1.
          This is NOT a "gotcha" interview They're being transparent: "Here's
          exactly what we'll do together" They're showing you the basic toolset
          upfront (the tools you mentioned: IOptions, Middleware, NuGet, DI,
          XUnit, etc.) The goal: Master the basics so you can focus on solving
          real problems 2. The "Free Your Mind" Philosophy üß† They're saying:
          "If you're comfortable with these basic tools, you won't waste mental
          energy Googling 'how to use IOptions' during real work. Instead, you
          can focus on: Understanding business requirements Designing solutions
          Making architectural decisions" 3. What the Pairing Session Really Is
          üë• It's a simulation of real daily work, not an exam. They will: ‚úÖ
          Ask you to code together (like real pair programming) ‚úÖ Ask "Why?"
          questions - "Why did you choose Scoped instead of Transient?" ‚úÖ Ask
          about alternatives - "What are other ways to solve this?" ‚úÖ Throw
          curveballs - "Now add timeout handling" or "What if the API returns
          null?" ‚úÖ Watch your thought process - How do you approach problems?
          4. What You CAN and CANNOT Use üìö ‚úÖ ALLOWED (Encouraged!): Google
          Stack Overflow Official Microsoft docs Read articles, compare
          approaches Ask clarifying questions ‚ùå NOT ALLOWED: ChatGPT GitHub
          Copilot Any AI assistants Why? They want to see: How you research (do
          you find quality sources?) How you judge solutions (do you understand
          pros/cons?) How you think critically (can you evaluate if a Stack
          Overflow answer is good?) Your Interpretation - Slight Adjustment üîß
          You said: "practice some basics and understand the tool... During the
          interview, they will allow me to use Google... try the example, check
          and understand how and why" More accurately: Before the interview:
          Practice the basics NOW so you're comfortable During the interview: If
          you don't know something, Google it! But explain your reasoning as you
          go They want to see you can figure things out in real-time, like you
          would on the job What "Shine in the Interview" Means ‚ú® If you: ‚úÖ
          Practice the task they gave you beforehand ‚úÖ Study different
          approaches (pros/cons) ‚úÖ Can explain WHY you chose approach A over B
          ‚úÖ Can adapt when they throw changes at you ‚úÖ Use Google effectively
          during the session You'll shine! üåü Bottom Line üí° They're saying:
          "We're not testing if you've memorized syntax. We're testing if you
          can think like a developer, research effectively, make good decisions,
          and work collaboratively in a real-world scenario." Think of it as:
          "Show us how you would actually work on our team on a Tuesday
          afternoon." Does this clarify what they're looking for? Want to
          practice any specific scenarios they might throw at you? üòä
