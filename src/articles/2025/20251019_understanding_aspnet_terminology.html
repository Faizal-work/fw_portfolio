    <p>Some keywords for you to study to stand out (hint: Ask ChatGPT to explain
    them to you - using Chat in your own time to help with prep is OK, but you need
    to ask to EXPLAIN so you can discuss them with us):</p>
    
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Term</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>IOptions</strong></td>
          <td>The Options pattern for strongly-typed configuration access. Binds configuration from appsettings.json to C# classes and injects them into your services. Available in three variants: IOptions (singleton), IOptionsSnapshot (scoped), and IOptionsMonitor (real-time reload).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Middleware</strong></td>
          <td>Components that form the request/response pipeline in ASP.NET Core. Each middleware can process HTTP requests before and after the next component. Order matters - they execute sequentially (e.g., Authentication before Authorization).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>NuGet</strong></td>
          <td>The package manager for .NET (similar to npm for Node.js or pip for Python). Manages external libraries and dependencies for your projects. Packages are referenced in your .csproj file.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Dependency Injection</strong></td>
          <td>The built-in IoC (Inversion of Control) container in .NET. Instead of creating dependencies, they are injected into classes. Three lifetimes: Transient (new instance every time), Scoped (one per request), and Singleton (one for app lifetime).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>XUnit</strong></td>
          <td>A modern, popular testing framework for .NET. Uses [Fact] attribute for simple tests and [Theory] for parameterized tests. Follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and includes various assertion methods.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Parameterised Unit Test</strong></td>
          <td>Data-driven tests that run the same test logic with different input values. In XUnit, implemented using [Theory] attribute with [InlineData] or [MemberData] to provide test cases. Reduces code duplication and tests multiple scenarios efficiently.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>NSubstitute</strong></td>
          <td>A friendly mocking library for .NET testing (alternative to Moq). Creates fake implementations of interfaces to isolate code under test. Uses intuitive syntax like Substitute.For and Received() to verify method calls.</td>
        </tr>
