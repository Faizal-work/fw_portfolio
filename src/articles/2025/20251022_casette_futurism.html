        <h3>I have ideas, but I am unable to express it</h3>
        <p>I have lots to say. I have things I would like to verbalise, but it 
            never comes out . It is so weird</p>
        <p>Small rant done, but I wanna focus on casette futurism. 
            I keep seeing it on my Reddit feed, and I want to understand 
            why it fascinates me so much.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compared to my wife, who is a designer,
            I am the stooge that has to really think why a particular design
            attracts me. And least to say, not that many
        </p>
        <p>
            I am the kind of guy who dislikes minimalism, but maximalism. But even then,
            as per advised by my wife, even that takes effort since it will look like
            a junkyard than an art installment and/or expression of your soul if not 
            done right. And yes, I know nothing even when I copy the damn design. t's like
            I can follow one-to-one IKEA's design that somehow speaks to me, but I won't 
            like the end result.
        </p>
        <p>
            But casette futurism somehow speaks to me. I like Apple's philosophy. I like
            Dieter Ram, and I do love Braun's design. Not a brutalist fan, more like the 
            colonial design that I see in Samad Said Building or the old KTM building. They
            somehow excite and interest me.
        </p>
        <p>
            Hell, even the first Ninjago City that I had bought really spoke to my soul. I
            bought it when I was at my lowest, and that really helped me move on. SO yeah, 
            city design like that or Kowloon City mixed with the casette aesthetic really
            appeals to me.
